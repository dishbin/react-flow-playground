### Just a simple react flow demo:
- Ability to add nodes from one of the three types and make connections between them
- Clicking on a node or an edge gives you some details on the element

Mostly doing this to get a glimpse of the functionality of this library. This isn't even close to the total functionailty, this library is actually really rad.

#### run 'npm i' after cloning to install relevant dependencies, which include:
- React
- React Flow Renderer
